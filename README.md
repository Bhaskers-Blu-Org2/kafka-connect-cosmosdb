# Kafka Connect for Azure Cosmos DB
________________________

Kafka Connect for Azure Cosmos DB consists of 2 connectors - a Source connector and a Sink connector. 

The Source connector is used to pump data from [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db//) to
[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). The Sink connector reads messages from Kafka and sends them to Cosmos DB. 

For more information on the capabilities of the connectors and how to use them, please refer to the links below -
